## üîÆ Future Improvements

I have several ideas for enhancing this project further:

-   [ ] **User Authentication:** Add Firebase Auth to allow users to sign up and save their resumes.
-   [ ] **Firestore Integration:** Save previously generated cover letters to a user's account in a Firestore database.
-   [ ] **Tone Selection:** Add a dropdown to let the user select a tone (e.g., "Professional," "Enthusiastic," "Formal").
-   [ ] **PDF Export:** Implement a feature to download the generated cover letter as a PDF file.
